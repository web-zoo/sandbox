This site

Pulls data from here

* https://aviationweather.gov/products/nws/saltlakecity?&fint=12&lvl=lo
* https://aviationweather.gov/products/nws/saltlakecity?&fint=24&lvl=lo

Going through the front door leads to 

https://aviationweather.gov/windtemp/data?region=slc

which links to the same data at

* https://aviationweather.gov/windtemp/data?level=l&fcst=12&region=slc&layout=on
* https://aviationweather.gov/windtemp/data?level=l&fcst=24&region=slc&layout=on

Params:

* `region=all` / gets you [all](https://aviationweather.gov/windtemp/data?level=l&fcst=06&region=all&layout=off) sites, seems unique to this interface!

The 6, 12, and 24 hr data headers are:

    FBUS31 KWNO 270202
    FD1US1
    
    FBUS33 KWNO 270202
    FD3US3
    
    FBUS35 KWNO 270202
    FD5US5

but what does that mean?

FBUS31 &rarr; FB is *data type designator* for wind and temperature aloft forecasts, the rest is ? but the US seems to relate to teh 

KWNO &rarr; "originating office"???? from WMO heading?

270202 &rarr; is maybe the time the forecast was made?

FD1US1 &rarr; FD1 is *Product Identifier*, and *Office Identifier*, this is *AWIPS ID*

See [NWS Communications Header Policy Document](http://www.nws.noaa.gov/tg/awips.php) for more info on header structure, as well as [International Codes & Bulletin Heading Practices](http://www.nws.noaa.gov/tg/metcode.php) and [Explanation of Data Designators T1T2A1A2ii CCCC](http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/ois/Operational_Information/Publications/WMO_386/AHLsymbols/AHLsymbols_en.html) (and see other stuff at the [WMO](https://www.wmo.int/pages/index_en.html)). [Weather Communications Codes: A Breathless Overview](http://www.ominous-valve.com/wx_codes.txt) is a nice overview.

A search brought me to:

http://forecast.weather.gov/product.php?site=NWS&issuedby=US1&product=FD1&format=CI&version=1&glossary=1

http://forecast.weather.gov/product.php?site=CAE&issuedby=US1&product=FD1&format=TXT&version=1&glossary=1

Params:

* `site=NWS` seems to refer to the office, or region (e.g. WRH), or NWS for general. 
* `format=TXT` for a plain text version or `CI` for the full site.
* `version=1` is current version, 

Check that these on weather.gov are current! Esp. wrt versions 2+. Aviationweather might be more reliable? Verify once codes understood

>  Wind and temperature aloft forecasts are issued in bulletins identified by the data type designator "FB" in the World Meteorological Organization (WMO)

Actually US refers to CONUS, AK Alaska, HW Hawaii, OC Pacific Sites. It's not clear what CN is!

    Actual Altitude (feet)
    3,000
    6,000
    9,000
    12,000
    
    Pressure Altitude (feet)
    18,000(500hPa)
    24,000(400hPa)
    30,000(300hPa)
    34,000(250hPa)
    39,000(200hPa)

There are 6, 12, and 24 hour forecasts.

Format DDff+TT which is:

wind direction
: tens of degrees, true north

wind speed
: knots, l&v or <5 knots is 9900, see ref for encoding of >100 knots

temperature
: celcius, and +/- for 6,000-24,000 levels, above 24K assumed negative

Note that the NWS regions are:

* Alaska Region
* Central Region
* Eastern Region
* Pacific Region
* Southern Region
* Western Region

NWS has *Local Forecast Offices* and [*Center Weather Serice Units*](http://www.nws.noaa.gov/aviation/pages/CWSU/CWSU.php) ([alt](https://aviationweather.gov/cwamis))

Note, there may be able to get wind forecast data from RAP model!

Review METARs sites - they may be worth getting the list and mapping.

There is a RAOB software and it has potentially useful info about where to get data: see [RAOB Data Types](http://raob.com/data_type.php) and [Data Sources](http://raob.com/data_sources.php).
